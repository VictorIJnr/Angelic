# Angelic
## Introduction
At the risk of sounding like an edgy 12 year old, this, is God is Dead. A Social Deduction Party Game where you play as either a member of the divine, or an ever-curious human being. Well, this **_WAS_** God is Dead. But I don't want to come across as an edgelord. So I rebranded it Angelic.

## Backstory
Divinity find themselves among mere humans, because God, this supposedly omnipotent being screwed up. She's here too. ~~Ariana Grande said God is a woman so it must be true.~~ 
Humanity, as you all know, are, interesting. You know with their Philosophy and trying to find the meaning of life, they aim to uncover as much information about the divine as possible. But, you see, that's a little too pesky as far as the divine are concerned. 

## Gameplay
In Angelic, deception, deduction and interrogations are your friends. Talking with your fellow players, as well as using your brain, provide you with the first two. I provide the platform for the third. Makes creating this game a hell of a lot easier, especially when I had, what, 3 weeks? Well that and a bunch of other deadlines. Uni's fun :D

Anyway, the gameplay is pretty simple. Everyone goes to bed. Apart from Angels, they don't need sleep. They choose to "take care" of a human of their choice. Everyone wakes up. An interrogation is carried out on a democratically-chosen player by a group of investigators. Then, as a group, you lynch the crap out of a player. Why? Maybe they're suspect af? No, you don't like how they look. Perhaps they said they met your mum over Xbox Live? Whatever, it's up to you. <span style="font-size:0.1em">Just don't gamethrow plz.</span>

## Objectives
Thing is, humans are dumb, they can't tell the difference between angels and other humans. So, carrying out the right interrogations is crucial. Interrogations are the only way to find out the roles of other players whilst they're alive. If they're a human, fine. Angels? Well, as a human, it's in your best interest they get voted to be killed. But all the investigators have to ensure an interrogation gets enough votes to be carried out. Otherwise it's skipped and everyone instead votes to kill a player. When they die, their role will be revealed to the group.

Granted, only divinity know other divine players, humans are left oblivious as to the roles of everyone. You'll need to talk and use your powers of deduction - however terrible - to get more information. After all, it's a party game. People talk at parties. Right? 

Divinity's goal is to eradicate all the human's they come in contact with. You can't have all these pesky, weak, little mortals knowing too much now can you?

Humanity, need to interrogate all the angels before that happens. If someone's very obviously human you don't exactly want them dead if you're a human now do you? No. The answer's no. If you're an angel however, sure. <span style="font-size:0.05em">Fuck 'em.</span>

Granted, you'll need to keep in mind that not all investigators are human. Angels can poison the pool of investigators and subsequently make an investigation fail. Food for thought.

## Joining Angelic
Yeah, at the beginning I said this was a party game, but no one's going to be carrying my code around with them. Especially if I do this all in Processing. Like, ew. So instead, you'll be able to join any game with your phone. Easy. BUT. One kid still needs to be able to run Angelic from their laptop. Just as a server though. They don't play on their computer, they also play on their phone.

## Setting up a Server
For that, you need [Processing](https://processing.org/download/). So get that downloaded before you do anything else.

Done? Good. Once you've got that, you'll want to open this up as a project in Processing. The next step is so intuitive that even a human could figure it out. Pressy press press big green button! Now you've got your server. Just tell everyone else to follow the instructions on the screen and you're good to go. Heads up, the phone client may take a while to load. That's fine, it's just Heroku doing it's own thing. <sup style="font-size: 0.4em">I could pay to make it quicker but I don't exactly have the funds to do that. Plust this doesn't exactly have a Fortnite audience does it?</sup>

BUT. This working is dependent on me paying DigitalOcean. You see I set up room hosting in such a manner that it's stored on DigitalOcean. If I don't pay it, rooms can't be hosted. It's that simple. Sucks but if I don't have a need for DigitalOcean, this'll just be an unfortunate repercussion.

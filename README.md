## Introduction

At the risk of sounding like an edgy 12 year old, this, is God is Dead. A Social Deduction Party Game testing the strongest of friendships.

## Backstory

Divinity find themselves among mere humans, because God, this supposedly omnipotent being screwed up. She's here too. ~~Ariana Grande said God is a woman so it must be true.~~ 
Humanity, as you all know, are, interesting. You know with their Philosophy and trying to find the meaning of life, they aim to uncover as much information about the divine as possible. But, you see, that's a little too pesky as far as the divine are concerned. 

## Gameplay

In God is Dead, you play as either a member of the divine, aiming to conceal your existence. Or a curious mortal searching for the truth. 

Interrogations are performed by a subset of players onto a suspect. If the interrogation reveals that the suspect is an angel. They die. But interrogations may only be carried out if all the interrogators, anonymously choose to go forward with it. Only the divine can decline an interrogation. 

If an interrogation didn't succeed, everyone votes to kill a player. When they die, their role will be revealed to the group.

Granted, only divinity know other divine players, humans are left oblivious as to the roles of everyone. You'll need to talk to get more information. After all, it is a party game.

Divinity's goal is to eradicate anyone who knows too much. Humanity, need to interrogate all the angels before that happens.

# Angelic
## Introduction

At the risk of sounding like an edgy 12 year old, this, is God is Dead. A Social Deduction Party Game where you play as either a member of the divine, or an ever-curious human being.

## Gameplay
In God is Dead, deception, deduction and interrogations are your friends. Talking with your fellow players, as well as using your brain, provide you with the first two. I provide the platform for the third.

So, the gameplay is pretty simple. Everyone goes to bed. Apart from Angels, they don't need sleep. They choose to "take care" of a human of their choice. Everyone wakes up. An interrogation is carried out on a democratically-chosen player by a group of investigators. Then, as a group, you lynch the crap out of a player. Maybe they're suspect as hell. Maybe you don't like how they look, up to you.

Thing is, humans are dumb, they can't tell the difference between angels and other humans. So, carrying out the right interrogations is crucial.

Yeah, at the beginning I said this was a party game, but no one's going to be carrying my code around with them. So you'll be able to join any game with, your phone.

If an interrogation didn't succeed, everyone votes to kill a player. When they die, their role will be revealed to the group.

Granted, only divinity know other divine players, humans are left oblivious as to the roles of everyone. You'll need to talk to get more information. After all, it is a party game.

Divinity's goal is to eradicate anyone who knows too much. Humanity, need to interrogate all the angels before that happens.

## Backstory

Divinity find themselves among mere humans, because God, this supposedly omnipotent being screwed up. She's here too. ~~Ariana Grande said God is a woman so it must be true.~~ 
Humanity, as you all know, are, interesting. You know with their Philosophy and trying to find the meaning of life, they aim to uncover as much information about the divine as possible. But, you see, that's a little too pesky as far as the divine are concerned.
